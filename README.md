My project was from IT140 and is a Python script that implements a text-based game called "Conflict Avoidance Game." The goal of the game is to collect all four report cards while avoiding a bully. The script uses a dictionary to represent the layout of the game and defines two functions to handle displaying instructions and the state of the game.

 

The problem my project was solving was to create a fun and engaging game that could be played through a simple command-line interface. It demonstrates how to use Python dictionaries to represent game states and how to use functions to separate different parts of the game logic.

 

The code does a good job of separating game logic into functions and provides clear and concise instructions to the player. The layout of the game is well-defined and easily customizable.

 

One area for improvement I would like to add is error handling for invalid inputs, to make the code more robust and secure. Additionally, adding more comments and documentation could improve the readability and maintainability of the code.

 

The most challenging part of writing this code was the logic for checking whether the player has collected all four report cards and avoiding the bully in room 'RM666'. To overcome this, I uses a loop and a delay to simulate the player being caught by the bully. To support this project, resources like documentation, online tutorials, and help from peers or instructors were beneficial to me 

 

The skills from this project that will be transferable to other projects or coursework include using dictionaries to represent data, creating functions to handle different parts of the game logic, and developing user interfaces through the command line.

 

To make the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable, the code uses clear and concise variable names, separates the game logic into functions, and provides comments to explain what each part of the code is doing. Additionally, the code is structured in a way that makes it easy to modify or expand the game layout or instructions.
